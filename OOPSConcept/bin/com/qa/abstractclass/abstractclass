abstract class have both abstract and non abstract methods
abstract method is prototype method

we cannot create object of an abstract class
abstract class can be inherit but cannot instatiate, we can create constructor for abstract class which will be called when we create object of sub class
subclass constrcutor will be called,jvm will see parent child relationship,before executing subclass constrcutor,it will call parent class constructor

no abs method-0% abstraction
some abs method + some non abs method-partial abstraction
all abs method-100% abstraction
	
we can achieve 0 to 100 % abstraction through abstract class
but interface is 100 % abstraction

when to use interface and when to use abstrtact class
whenever we have to use partial abstraction then use abstract class because we have more flexibility
in interface we have fully abstraction we cant give any business logic
whenever we have to define very strict rule we have to use interface
