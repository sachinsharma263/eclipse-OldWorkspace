inheriting something from parent
inheriting property from parent,there must be some relationship between you and that person and that relationship is parent and child
getting some properties from parent but there are certain rules are defined.

in java inheritance means inheriting properties from a parent class

let say Car is a class having some properties like start,stop

Bmw,Audi,Honda is also class and child of Car.
we can say Bmw,Audi and Honda are Cars.All basic properties a Car have, Bmw audi and Honda also have

Advantage of creating relationship btw Car and Bmw,Audi and Honda-->using inheritance is reusability
if inheritance is not there than same repetative code we have to write-->those features inside Car we have again define in Bmw 
what if Bmw is creating a seperate Car concept

a child Bmw can inherit all properties from parent but at the same time can have its own properties.

In inheritance a child can inherit properties from parent
a parent cant inherit any property from child
A grandchild can inherit from Grand parent
Siblings cant inherit property from each other
Multiple inheritance not allowed at class level,a class cant have 2 or more parents
Diamnond problem-can be solved by interface

Car can also have parent Vehicle


Method Overriding-
When a method in a subclass has the same name, same parameters or signature, and same return type(or sub-type) as a method in its super-class,
 then the method in the subclass is said to override the method in the super-class.
 Overriding Method must have the same return type (or subtype)
From Java 5.0 onwards, it is possible to have a different return type for an overridden method in the child class provided that the return type of
 child class be the same as a subtype of the overridden method’s return type of the base class. This type of return type is called a covariant return type.
