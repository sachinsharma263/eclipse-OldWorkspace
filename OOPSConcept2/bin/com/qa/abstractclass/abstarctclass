Abstract class
abstract class can have both abstract and non abstract method. abstract method means prototype method or method declaration
we cannot create object of abstract class but constructor can be created
	
when to use interface and abstract class?
whenever we have to use partial abstraction,we will always use abstract class.abstract class more popular than interface because we have 
more flexibilty.
and whenever we required full abstraction then we will use interface,whenever we have to define very strict rule just like selenium webdriver,
 enforce all these method should be implemented these browseres
 
no abstract method-0% abstraction
some abstract methods and some non abs methods-partial abstraction
only abstract methods-100% abstraction

interface is always 100 percent abstraction where we have only prototype methods

we can achieved 0 to 100 percent abstraction through abstract classes
