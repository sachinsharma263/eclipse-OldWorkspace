inheriting something from parent
inheriting property from parent,there must be some relationship between you and that person and that relationship is parent and child
getting some properties from parent but there are certain rules are defined.

in java inheritance means inheriting properties from a parent class

let say Car is a class having some properties like start,stop

Bmw,Audi,Honda is also class and child of Car.
we can say Bmw,Audi and Honda are Cars.All basic properties a Car have, Bmw audi and Honda also have

Advantage of creating relationship btw Car and Bmw,Audi and Honda-->using inheritance is reusability
if inheritance is not there than same repetative code we have to write-->those features inside Car we have again define in Bmw 
what if Bmw is creating a seperate Car concept

a child Bmw can inherit all properties from parent but at the same time can have its own properties.

In inheritance a child can inherit properties from parent
a parent cant inherit any property from child
A grandchild can inherit from Grand parent
Siblings cant inherit property from each other
Multiple inheritance not allowed at class level,a class cant have 2 or more parents
Diamnond problem-can be solved by interface

Car can also have parent class i.e Vehicle

Multiple inheritance- one child having 2 or more parent is multiple inheritance
Multiple inheritance not possible at class level why?

let us assume that multiple inheritance allowed at class level.Let assume class:parent 1 has run method,also class:parent 2 too has run method. 
Child class inherited these two classes. Now,i created object of child class like Child obj=new Child() and using child class object i called run method.
Now which class run method will be call either parent 1 or parent 2 by JVM.
If compiler allowed multiple inheritance then while executing or at run time which class run method will be call? by JVM. Ambiquity will come,jvm will get 
confused sure as JVM cannot take decesion on its own and at last will throw  run time exception so in order to prevent this java will restrict user and 
doesnt allowed multiple inheritance.
