polymorphism is nothing but multiple form of anything
Polymorphism-poly means many and morphism means forms
forms-functionality/many behaviour of same thing
in java 2 types of polymorphism or in java polymorphism can be achived by 2 ways
1.compile time polymorphism also called method overloading/early binding/static binding
2. runtime polymorphism-also called method overriding/late binding/dynamic binding
polymorphism is implemented at method level only/polymorphism applied at method level
polymorphism=many+forms

Inheritance applied at class level

method signature-combination of method name+parameter list
add(int a)

Method Overloading-within the same class when we have different methods with the same name but
different parameters
different types of parameter
different sequence of parameter
method overloading is also called compile time polymorphism because at time time compiler decides which method to call, compiler is not confused
super happy in taking decesion which method to call.At compile time compiler binds method against statement to call method.

when we have multiple methods but with same name but having different method signature is knows as method overloading

 Method Overriding- it can be achieved during inheritance When a method in a subclass has the same name, same parameters or signature, 
and same return type(or sub-type) as a method in its super-class, then the method in the subclass is said to override the method in the super-class.
 Method overriding is one of the way by which java achieve Run Time Polymorphism.At run time java will decide which method to call,it is also called 
 late binding/dynamic binding
