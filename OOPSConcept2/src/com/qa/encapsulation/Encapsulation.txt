class members- variables+methods

in a class we have variables and methods. when we encapsulate variables within in the method is called encapsulation.
we are encapsulating variables inside the methods.

inside class A{
we have 3 variables v1,v2 and v3
3 methods:m1,m2 and m3
}
let say B is a user and he is bother about only one method m1 for launching browser
further launching browser method calling several other methods ,services but user is nt bother abt other method.
user says give me one method where i click and browser gets open,user nt bother abt internal implementation.
 
 from system point view also why to show other methods to user,what he will going to do with this methods.
 
 As a user i am not bother abt how my car clutch working,brake ,gear working, frm system and user point of viw i need some ui,some method to shift gears thats all.
 
 give me a stering method,give me a gear knob,give me accelator,brake method so that i can drive the car,internal implementation i am nt bother.
 
 same thing in OOPS we have encapsulation feature where in my class i want to hide the implementation,dnt expose implementation to the user ,user is also nt bother abt it 
 and frm system point of view is is nt required.
 
 This concept is actually called an encapsulation.
 
 Now,how to use in the form of coding
 i will do one thing i will create one class
 
 3 ways to initialize class variables
 1.create object and then objectrefernce.variable
 2.by constructor
 3. by using getter and setter
 Getter and setter are two special methods for each class variable
 first you set and then get
 
 this keyword-->refer to current class object
 
 encapsulation  is what ?
 there is 2 or 3 concept here-->whenever you have private implementation which you dnt want to expose dire ctly to the user,i want to hide my implementation in that
 case you can hide by declaring private but you can give indirect access/you can create public layer on top of that in the form of getter and setter
 we created wrappers -method in which we wrapped private variable inside public method
 user cannot directly access private implementation but indirectly can access
 
 so in encapsulation -we can have some private variable inside class,we have encapsulate these variables inside methods-public layer
 
 In company class we have encapsulate our variables within methods,where we have public +private variables where we encapulsate these variables
 within methods. 
 
 Now can we encapsulate methods or not?yes we can 
 now BrowserUtil class we have methods.
 
 Take an example of any library in the world,they will not exposed all methods to the user
 
 encapsulation-when you encapsulate data members(variable+method) with a capsule.
( Private/public variable+private/public method) encapsulated with a public layer so that user can access this public layer.
