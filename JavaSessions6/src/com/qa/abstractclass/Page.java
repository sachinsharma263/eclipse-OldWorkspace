	// No abs method-0% abstraction
	// some abs methods and some non abs methods-partial abstraction
	// all abs methods-100% abstraction

	// we can achieve 0to100% abstraction but interface is 100% abstraction

	// when use interface and abstract class
	// whenever we have t use partial abs we can use abstract class.Here we have
	// more flexibility. this are methods u have to use and this u have to define
	// ur own.But in interface u hav to use same concept/feature but business logic
	// will be yous.wheneer u have to define very strict rule just like selenium
	// webdriver use interface.
	// webdriver says i dnt want to take any rsponsibity for any web browser because
	// i dnt know how business logic will behave in different browser
	//se guys give these are concept/feature and u have to implement this.respective browser classes fine i will use these features but business logic
	//will be ours.
