A user might wonder that what is the difference between driver.switchTo().parentFrame() and driver.switchTo().defaultContent() methods? They might look slightly similar in the first glance.

driver.switchTo().defaultContent(): This will pass the control to the main document which contains the iframes.
driver.switchTo().parentFrame(): This will pass the control to the immediate parent frame of the current frame.
