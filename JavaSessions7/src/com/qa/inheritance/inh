inheritance means inheriting something from your parent
inheret property from parent class

if we dnt create a relationship with car and bmw then disadvantage is
1. Repetative code we have to write
whatever feature include a car same we have to write inside a bmw
2.what if bmw creating a seperate car concept

Idealy bmw extends car
whatever property a car have,same property given to bmw.
bmw says fine i am inheriting some property from car but i own my own property too.

parent cannot inheret from child.

static method can be overloaded-main method overloading
static method cant be override

Car class having start method-child class like bmw inherit properties from Car. Bmw use same feature/concept(start) provided by Car.In this way Bmw doesnt have
to define start,it will simply inherit start method from parent.But sometimes bmw says hey Car your start method is very boring,not upto we want,you are manual
start but we want automatic so we will use same feature/concept but busines logic/implemetation will be ours so we will override start method.
