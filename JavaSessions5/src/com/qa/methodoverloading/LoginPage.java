/**
 * Polymorphism- poly means many 
 * morphism-many forms
 * Ploymorphism in java can be achieved by either method overloading or method overriding
 * 
 * Method Overloading-is within the same class, when we have different methods with the same name but with
 * different parameters
 * diff types of parameter
 * diff sequence of parameters
 * 
 * method overloading is also called compile time polymorphism because at time time compiler decides which method to call, compiler is not confused
 * super happy taking decesion.At compile time compiler binds method against statement to call method.
 * also called early binding
 * 
 * Method Overriding- it can be achieved during inheritance When a method in a subclass has the same name, same parameters or signature, 
 * and same return type(or sub-type) as a method in its super-class, then the method in the subclass is said to override the method in the super-class.
 * Method overriding is one of the way by which java achieve Run Time Polymorphism.At run time java will decide which method to call,it is also called 
 * late binding
