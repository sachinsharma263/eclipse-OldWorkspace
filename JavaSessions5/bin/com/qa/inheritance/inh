inheritance means inheriting something from your parent
inheret property from parent class

if we dnt create a relationship with car and bmw then disadvantage is
1. Repetative code we have to write
whatever feature include a car same we have to write inside a bmw
2.what if bmw creating a seperate car concept

Idealy bmw extends car
whatever property a car have,same property given to bmw.
bmw says fine i am inheriting some property from car but i own my own property too.

parent cannot inheret from child.
